# Melee Tools
A Blender addon to help streamline the model editing workflow

## SSBM Skin Creation Tutorial (For Blender)

### Software and Resources
Listed below are programs and addons that are essential to creating a skin for Melee.
* [**Blender**](https://www.blender.org/download/lts/3-3/)[^1] - An open source, free-to-use 3D modelling program, and the program used to manipulate and change the desired 3D models.
  * [**Blender Source Tools**](http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/) - A Blender addon necessary for importing and exporting `.smd` files.
  * Installing Blender addons is a simple process. [Click here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html#installing-add-ons) to read on how to do it, or look up [a Youtube video](https://youtu.be/vYh1qh9y1MI), there's plenty available.
* [**HSDRaw**](https://github.com/Ploaj/HSDLib/releases) - Created by Ploaj, HSDRaw is the second essential workspace for skin creation, allowing users to manipulate `.dat` files in many ways: importing and exporting models, changing textures, even change in-game characteristics.
  *  For this tutorial, it will primarily be used to export character armatures/skeletons, and import custom models to work in-game.
* [**DAT Texture Wizard**](https://github.com/DRGN-DRC/DAT-Texture-Wizard/releases/tag/v6.1.4) - Created by DRGN, DTW is used for manipulating Melee ISOs and the `.dat` files within. 
  *  For this tutorial it will primarily be used to import and export character `.dat` files, and change textures.
* An Image Editor - For editing and creating textures, it can be any that you're comfortable with. Below are a few good (free) options.
  *  [**GIMP**](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) - An open-source Photoshop clone that's been around for a long time. Has all the necessary tools to create textures for use in the tutorial.
  *  [**Photopea**](https://www.photopea.com/) - A browser based image editor with a similar feature set and layout to Photoshop. Plus it's within your browser, so if you don't want to download more software, it's a decent pick
  * [**Paint.NET**](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) - Less robust features than the previous two options, but it's relatively simple to use for simpler texture edits.

[^1]: I've linked Blender's LTS (Long Term Support) branch for its stability, but feel free to use the [latest available version](https://www.blender.org/download/).
